title: Machine Learning
brief: |
    GrammaTech leverages statistical machine learning to bring the power of
    large data sets to bear in soft decisions helping to answers program understanding
    and generation questions when deterministic methods are impossible or impractical.

We have successfully employed deep learning techniques to identify
N-days in software binaries resulting in our newest commercial product
in [codesentry][].  We were one of the first to apply machine learning
to decompilation in our work [Using Recurrent Neural Networks for
Decompilation][].
