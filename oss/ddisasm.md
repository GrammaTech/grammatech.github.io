brief: |
    A fast and accurate disassembler.  DDisasm is able to disassemble
    real-world stripped binaries with accuracy sufficient to enable modification
    and reassembly.  The core disassembly logic is implemented in datalog
    resulting in *fast* parallel disassembly, and the easy declarative specification
    of disassembly heuristics.

The engine underlying our industry-leading binary analysis and
rewriting technology has been
[published](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity20/presentation/flores-montoya)
and released as open-source software, including the
[manuals](https://grammatech.github.io/gtirb) and
[tutorials](https://grammatech.github.io/gtirb/md_stack-stamp.html)
required for use and evaluation.
