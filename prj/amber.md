AMBER (Autonomic Monitoring and Mitigation with Blockchain-Enabled Reporting) is a solution to harden Internet of Things (IoT) devices against cyber attacks. AMBER provides end-to-end protections, relying on:
* a framework for semiautomatically generating runtime verification policies and attack mitigation techniques
* functionality for installing the policies and mitigation techniques on IoT devices through binary instrumentation
* a distributed, blockchain-based logging framework to encode and report perceived attacks across devices, supporting 
 secure, redundant real-time reporting as well as forensic playback
* a Reasoning Engine server software application and tools to perform secondary, offline forensic and remediation efforts to mitigate future attacks, as well as reporting suspected attacks to system administrators and analysts.

AMBER works by identifying expected (correct) device-specific behavior and reporting deviations. Unlike many state-of-the-art techniques that only attempt to identify previously-seen attacks, AMBER's approach allows protecting against both *known* and *unknown* attacks. AMBER provides comprehensive and persistent cyber protection for zero-trust devices and software, without interfering with the ability to carry out mission-essential functions.
