    An intermediate representation for binary analysis and rewriting.
    GTIRB seeks to be an LLVM-IR for reverse engineering.
---

GTIRB is GrammaTech's Intermediate Representation for Binary analysis
and rewriting.  It seeks to be for binaries what LLVM is for source
allowing researchers and developers to compose tools and leverage each
other's work. GTIRB is described in a [blog][], [whitepaper][],
[tutorial][], and in its [manual][].  GTIRB is a relatively simple
data structure (shown below).

The GTIRB data structure tries to structurally require the minimal
analysis results that are required for binary analysis and rewriting.
All other analysis results and properties can be stored in AuxData
tables (there are a large number of [standard AuxData tables][]).
GTIRB is generated by GrammaTech's [DDisasm][] best-in-class
reassembleable disassembler.  Both GTIRB and DDisasm are open source
software.

## Open-source GTIRB tools and libraries
A growing number of open-source tools and libraries are emerging that
emit and consume GTIRB:

|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| [DDisasm][]             | Fast and accurate disassembler which produces GTIRB           |
| [GTIRB-PPrinter][]      | Pretty print GTIRB to assembler or a binary executable        |
| [GTIRB-VSCode][]        | VSCode extension to read, navigate, and (re)write GTIRB files |
| [gtirb-rewriting][]     | Python API for rewriting GTIRB files                          |
| [gtirb-functions][]     | APIs for working with functions in GTIRB files                |
| [gtirb-ghidra-plugin][] | Import/Export GTIRB files to/from Ghidra                      |
| [gtirb-capstone][]      | Integration with the [Capstone][] decoder                     |
| [gtirb-stack-stamp][]   | Example hardening transform over GTIRB                        |

## Proprietary GTIRB transforms

GrammaTech maintains the following proprietary GTIRB transforms which
may be used to secure binaries in production settings and are designed
to easily slot into existing CI/CD or Dev-Sec-Ops pipelines.

## Rewriting binaries with GTIRB

A good entry point for those new to GTIRB is the Python rewriting API,
[gtirb-rewriting][].  The following video introduces GTIRB Rewriting
and walks through the creation of an example binary transform from
scratch.
