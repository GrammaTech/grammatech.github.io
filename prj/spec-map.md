brief: |
    Spec-map automatically aligns large specification documents and code bases.
---

SPEC-MAP discovers mappings between software specifications and source
code. Using an iterative approach, it looks for matches
between elements of a specification document and components of
programs that implement the specification. SPEC-MAP has many
potential uses: it can serve as an onboarding tool and reference for
developers of complex software projects, support the creation of
tests for modules and subsystems driven by specific requirements, and
simplify maintenance of legacy software by mapping specification changes to the 
affected program components.
