brief: |
    Spec-map automatically aligns large specification documents and code bases.
---

SPEC-MAP discovers mappings between software specification and source
code.  Using an iterative approach, correspondences are discovered
between elements of a specification document and components of
programs that implement the specification.  SPEC-MAP has many
potential uses, including as an onboarding tool and reference for
developers of complex software projects, enabling the construction of
tests of modules and subsystems driven by specified requirements, and
mapping changes in a specification to the affected program components
for the maintenance of legacy software.
