    Spec-map automatically aligns large specifications documents and code bases.

SPEC-MAP discovers mappings between software specifications and source
code.  Using an iterative approach, correspondences are discovered
between elements of a specification document and components of
programs that implement the specification.  SPEC-MAP has
many potential benefits, ranging from accelerating the onboarding
of developers to complex software projects, enabling construction
of semantically meaningful tests of modules and subsystems, and
targeting program synthesis for update of "brownfield" software.
