REAFFIRM
========

REAFFIRM (Reverse Engineer, Analyze and Fix Firmware) is a platform
for firmware analysis, component identification and extraction, and
testing. REAFFIRM facilitates cyber security assessments for
cyber-physical systems used in the military (weapons controls,
navigation systems), critical infrastructure (industrial-control
systems) and everyday applications (automotive controls, medical
devices).
 
Analysts using REAFFIRM can achieve a deep understanding of firmware;
our system extracts security-relevant components from firmware, and
presents and ranks them by relevance.
 
Cyber security testers can use REAFFIRM to extract key components for
testing. Because our system identifies, isolates, and virtualizes the
hardware-coupled portions of firmware components, testing can proceed
in a virtualized environment, without the expense and risk of damage
associated with using real hardware.
 
Through its use of data science tools such as Jupyter notebooks,
REAFFIRM supports reproducibility and gradual automation of analyst
and cybersecurity tester workflows.
