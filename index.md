### Open Source Software

We are a commercial company and we develop and sell proprietary
software products. However, we release the core technology underlying
these products â€” the libraries on which these product's power and
correctness depend.  GrammaTech recognizes that only by encouraging
outside use and review of our software can we achieve the
reproducibility, objectivity, accuracy, quality, and security our
customers require.

{% for oss in collections.oss %}

[{{ oss.data.title }}]({{ oss.url |url }})
:   {{ oss.data.brief }}

{% endfor %}
